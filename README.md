Flappy Bird Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to avoid the pipes and keep the bird in the air by pressing the Spacebar to make it flap.

Features
Smooth Gravity: The bird's gravity is set to a lower value for smoother gameplay.
Collision Detection: The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or goes out of bounds.
Score Tracking: The score is increased each time the bird successfully passes a pair of pipes.
Game Over Screen: When the game ends, a pop-up displays your score with an option to restart the game.
How to Play

The game starts with a "Game Over" popup. Press the Spacebar to start.
Press the Spacebar again to make the bird flap and avoid obstacles.
Each time you successfully pass a set of pipes, your score will increase.
The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or falls off the screen.
When the game ends, the Game Over screen will show your score with a Restart button. Click Restart to play again from the beginning with a score of 0.
