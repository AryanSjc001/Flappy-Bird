# Flappy Bird Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Flappy Bird** game using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of the game is to avoid the pipes and keep the bird in the air by pressing the **Spacebar** to make it flap.

## Features

- **Smooth Gravity**: The bird's gravity is set to a lower value for smoother gameplay.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or goes out of bounds.
- **Score Tracking**: The score is increased each time the bird successfully passes a pair of pipes.
- **Game Over Screen**: When the game ends, a pop-up displays your score with an option to restart the game.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to start the game.
2. The game starts with a **"Game Over"** popup. Press the **Spacebar** to start.
3. Press the **Spacebar** again to make the bird flap and avoid obstacles.
4. Each time you successfully pass a set of pipes, your score will increase.
5. The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or falls off the screen.
6. When the game ends, the **Game Over** screen will show your score with a **Restart** button. Click **Restart** to play again from the beginning with a score of 0.
